Visual Debugger for VSCode
==========================

This is an experimental extension for VSCode allowing you to plot your running
program as a complex graph, enabling you to filter, inspect and modify your
program on-the-fly.

## Features

Eventually, the extension will support the following features:

 - Plot your program state in a dynamic graph, with the ability to expand nodes and move parts of the graph.
 - A fuzzy finder that automatically slims down the graph to only contain the matching results.
 - Ability to edit values in the graph itself.

## Known Issues

This extension is experimental and things might not fully work yet, or the
extension may just not work in its entirity. Until the first version comes
out, there are no guarantees about the stability.

## License

This software is GNU-licensed, because I put a lot of work into making this
extension and I want the open-source nature of it to be preserved.
